This is QR decomposition RLS algorithm implementation based on ASIC, FPGA prototype, Zynq, CPU and cuda GPU acceleration.

The code will cover serveral applications: Adaptive Beamformer, RLS algorithm, System Identification, etc.

In the Matlab folder:
	data_gen.m: used to generate test vector file
	data_acq.m: to import the testbench results back to Matlab
	err_check.m: call data_acq.m to check the error margin between embedded platform and Matlab

In the processor folder:
	makefile: support Zynq and x86 compiler, Zynq library link is required

In the FPGA folder:
	the RTL code support both floating point and fixed point. Also, the generic can configure the hardware to be complex and real number computation.
